## Object Oriented Programming Paradigm

Every Object can be imagined as a collection of:
* States
* Methods

To create objects, blueprints are required.
C++ and Java use **classes** while Javascript uses **functions**.

## SOLID Design Principles

S -> Single Responsibility
* Each method is responsible for a single task.
* How is a single task defined? Unclear borders.
* Any subpart that can be re-usable can be defined as a single task.

O -> Open Close Principle
* One a method is created, it is:
	* Closed for change (preserves backward compatibility)
	* Open for extension (allows new abilities)

L -> Liskov Substitution Principle \[Generalization and Specialization\]

I -> Interface Segregation

D -> Dependency Injection

PS: Missing Zen of Python :(
